              The first day was spent driving to California from Arizona. It
              took about 5 hours. The first thing we did was go to a shopping
              center. The main reason for this first stop was that my girlfriend
              wanted to visit the Hello Kitty Cafe. We did some souvenir
              shopping and also took advantage of the shops to do Christmas
              shopping. After all of this, we checked into the hotel and slept
              for a couple of hours. The last hours of the day were spent
              finding a place to eat for dinner and dessert.

              For the second day, we slept in until around 11am. We packed our
              bags and headed straight for Disney land. When we first got there,
              we went looking for a place to eat breakfast. We chose to eat at
              an Italian food. One thing we learned is that everything at Disney
              is ridiculously expensive. Next time we want to make sure we eat
              BEFORE getting here. The first few hours were spent at the bottom
              park. After 12 we switched over to the top park. At around 9pm was
              supposed to be the Christmas fireworks. They were cancelled
              unfortunately due to "high winds". Upon hearing this, my
              girlfriend and I, along with practically everyone else in the
              park, decided to head out and leave since we all came to watch the
              fireworks.

            <div class="col-md-10 border">
              On our final day, we checked out of the hotel and headed to a
              restaurant to eat breakfast. After eating, we headed straight to
              6Flags. In all honesty, I was dreading 6Flags. I have a fear of
              heights and never did I dream of going. We made it after a couple
              of hours driving. The entire time I was nervous, not wanting to go
              on any rides. The first ride that my girlfriend picked out was the
              most extreme out of all of them in my opinion. It was called the
              X2. I chickened out and my girlfriend sat in the coaster by
              herself. I kept looking at her and I noticed how sad she got since
              she was doing it alone. I decided to conquer my fear and get on
              the ride with her. Not going to lie, it was so so so scary. But I
              was very happy that I went through with it in the end. After going
              to the most extreme ride, I felt like I was ready to conquer the
              rest. We stayed at the park for many many hours. I can't even
              remember at what time we left. It was finally time to head back
              home.

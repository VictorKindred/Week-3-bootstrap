                This was the first slow moving attraction ride I have ever been
                on. While this movie is not necessarily anywhere on my list of
                favorites. Instead, The Little Mermaid means a lot to my mom,
                therefore, I relate this series to her, bringing me a sense of
                familiarity. I sent the photos and videos to my mom back in Az
                and she told me that she really wants to go there. She said that
                just the videos alone made her cry.

                One of the more packed lines. Inside, the attraction uses very
                high quality screens to display Spiderman and robots, the
                details were rather realistic and convincing. After watching a
                short "performance", riders are guided to the actual rides. We
                equip special glasses that help us see the 3d effect of the
                ride. Our hands are motion tracked and thats when the fun
                starts; the car makes way to several different screens where we
                use our motion tracked hands to "shoot webs" at the interactive
                screen.

                I am not a Star Wars fan. Not that I dislike it, more like it
                never caught my attention so I never cared for it. The outside
                of this attraction looked really interesting and we wanted to
                give it a try since the line and wait time was short. It took us
                a very long time to walk to the inside of the building where the
                line actually begins. We joked that the walk to the line was the
                actual attraction. We waited a couple of minutes until the
                speaker turn on and told the crowd that the wait time was
                increased by 30 minutes. We felt lied to. Once the line
                diminished, we were taken inside the Millennium Falcon. It was
                huge and really caught my attention. Guests were separated into
                parties of 4 since it takes 4 people to play. Things took a
                twist when it was my party's turn. Two of the people decided to
                not come along me and my girlfriend and left us alone inside the
                game. When a four player game is played with only two people,
                you can tell how it went. The inside was very detailed. The
                screen, seats, sounds, and everything was immersive. Aside from
                inside, it was one the worst attractions and frankly a waste of
                time and money
